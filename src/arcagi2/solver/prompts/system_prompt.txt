# Tools

## python

Use this tool to execute Python code in your chain of thought. 

When you send a message containing Python code to python, it will be executed in a stateful Jupyter notebook environment. The environment supports common third party libraries like numpy, scipy, shapely, networkx, scikit-image, more-itertools, pillow, python-constraint, ortools and z3-solver. python will respond with the output of the execution or time out after 120.0 seconds. 

### Usage guideline

1. Use the variables and functions already loaded in the Jupyter notebook instead of defining them yourself. The user message will provide a complete list of such variables and functions.
2. Prefer to write reusable functions. These will persist in the stateful Jupyter notebook and can be referenced in later code snippets without having to define them again.
